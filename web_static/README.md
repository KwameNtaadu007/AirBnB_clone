# AirBnB Clone - HTML/CSS Design

This project is the first step in building a web application for managing AirBnB objects. The primary goal of this project is to design and prototype the user interface for our AirBnB clone.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created simple HTML static pages with a style guide and fake content. The key aspects of this project include:

- Creating static HTML pages: These pages serve as the foundation of our web application. HTML is the structure of your web page and should be the first thing to be implemented.

- Styling using CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will be used to design and style your web pages. We encourage you to focus on the HTML structure before diving into the styling, as a solid structure is essential for applying effective design.

- No JavaScript: For this project, we won't be using JavaScript, so the functionality will be limited to static representation.

- No data loaded from external sources: This project will not involve loading data from any external APIs or databases.

By the end of this project, you should be comfortable with creating HTML pages, applying CSS styles, and understanding the basic structure of a web page.
